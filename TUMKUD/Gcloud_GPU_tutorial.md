# Google Cloud Tutorial (Part 2 With GPUs) #
This tutorial assumes that you have already gone through the first Google Cloud tutorial for assignment 1 [here](http://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial/ "title"). The first tutorial takes you through the process of setting up a Google Cloud account, launching a VM instance, accessing Jupyter Notebook from your local computer, working on assignment 1 on your VM instance, and transferring files to your local computer. While you created a VM instance without a GPU in the first tutorial, this one walks you through the necessary steps to create an instance with a GPU, and use our provided disk images to work on assignment 2. If you haven't already done so, we advise you to go through the first tutorial to be comfortable with the process of creating an instance with the right configurations and accessing Jupyter Notebook from your local computer.
