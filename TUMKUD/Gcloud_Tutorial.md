# Google Cloud Tutorial
Many parts in this tutorial is modified from Stanford's [CS231n's tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial/)

# BEFORE WE BEGIN
## BIG REMINDER: Make sure you stop your instances!

(We know you won’t read until the very bottom once your assignment is running, so we are printing this at the top too since it is super important)

Don’t forget to stop your instance when you are done (by clicking on the stop button at the top of the page showing your instances), otherwise you will run out of credits and that will be very sad. :(

If you follow our instructions below correctly, you should be able to restart your instance and the downloaded software will still be available.

# Create and Configure Your Account

For class project and assignments, we will use Google Compute Engine for developing and testing your implementations. This tutorial lists the necessary steps of working on the assignments using Google Cloud. We expect this tutorial to take about an hour. Don’t get intimidated by the steps, we tried to make the tutorial detailed so that you are less likely to get stuck on a particular step. If you have any questions, ask in Piazza.

This tutorial goes through how to set up your own Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance to work on the assignments. When you sign up for the first time, you also receive $300 credits from Google by default. Please try to use the resources judiciously. 

First, if you don’t have a Google Cloud account already, create one by going to the Google Cloud homepage and clicking on Compute. When you get to the next page, click on the blue TRY IT FREE button. If you are not logged into gmail, you will see a page that looks like the one below. Sign into your gmail account or create a new one if you do not already have an account.
